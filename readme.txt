Welcome to the Magento-Ajax-resetPassword-Module wiki!

ho guys today i create new module which help customer to reset password.

WHY I BUILT THIS MODULE : i was working with Magento enterprise 1.1.13 which support to send password in email.so once user is on forget password after filling email address once user click on enter then magento reset user password and send to customer email address.

But client want oonce user click on enter system send email reset password link to customer so user can reset his own password.

NOTE : this feature was not in old versions this feature introduced in magento 1.1.16
